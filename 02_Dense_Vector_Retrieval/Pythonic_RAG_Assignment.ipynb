Smaller models behind APIs like OpenAI's are probably less expensive to use and faster. Larger models are more expensive (resource-use local, cost remote), but return more accurate results.\n2. I would go with the smallest model that is semantically accurate enough for the use case to save resources. Determining what is semantically accurate enough is difficult, and would probably require controlled testing (e.g., write a program that does a blind test by testing the same N queries against multiple models and having the final result be rated). This would allow determining if the incremental cost of the larger models provides actual value to the end result to help with a cost/benefit analysis."

Embedding each chunk sequentially in this manner would be very slow, and performing remote calls asynchronously and concurrently is a basic technique used by software systems to increase throughput.\n\nThe model we're using here is not on a remote server, so the main reason to perform embedding concurrently would be to allow multiple threads to do work across multiple cores on the local machine. The HuggingFace embedding model already effectively uses multithreading, so there is little real benefit in this instance from the async approach."

      "result = [x * 2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## **3. While Loops (For Conditional Iteration)**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "while condition:\n",
      "    # do something\n",
      "    pass\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## **4. Built-in Functions (Often the Best Choice!)**\n",

      "Response: Based on the investor letter, Stone Ridge's investment philosophy centers on several key principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Long-term Compounding and Relationships\n",
      "Stone Ridge emphasizes that \"Success, and failure, are lagging indicators\" - meaning current achievements stem from past decisions, not recent actions. The firm prioritizes **compounding wisdom and trust in relationships** over short-term results, recognizing that \"relationships also follow a Power Law\" and should be invested in accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Simplicity and Humility\n",
      "The firm maintains a simple business model with \"humility of our questions and the plainness of our\" approach (the quote continues beyond what's provided, but emphasizes letting simplicity be enough).\n",
      "\n",
      "## \"Just Right\" Risk Management\n",
      "Stone Ridge employs a Goldilocks approach to risk - avoiding extremes that are \"too cold\" (too conservative) or \"too hot\" (too risky):\n",
      "- **Alternative lending**: Prime, U.S.-only loans (avoiding AAA student loans and subprime/Emerging Markets)\n",
      "- **Single Family Rental (SFR)**: Homes priced $250-400k in steady markets like San Antonio (avoiding homes over $500k or under $150k, and avoiding boom/bust markets)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Principal-Led Investing\n",
      "Stone Ridge invests its own balance sheet in all its strategies (alternative lending, reinsurance, SFR, energy, art, market insurance, and bitcoin), serving as \"the seed investor and, whenever possible... the largest\" investor. This creates exceptional alignment with outside investors, as the firm profits as principals rather than agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This philosophy aims to balance risk and return while maintaining strong alignment between the firm and its investors.\n",

   "source": "##### ✅ Answer:\nTo make the LLM have a more thoughtful, detailed response, we can use Chain-of-Thought Prompting, as described in the assigned reading \"Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models.\" This builds on few-shot prompting to provide examples that effectively have the LLM produce a result that reasons instead of just coming up with an answer. For example, if I say \"what's 2+4-1?\", the LLM might say \"7\", or it might not (probably will since this is a simplified example). But if I give an example of how to solve it in context that says \"This equation can be modified to ((2+4)-1) and executed in steps. (2+4) is (6). (6-1) is 5. The answer is 5.\" then the model will follow that line of reasoning on other problems and be more likely to get the answer right."

    "- **Multi-Document Support**: Allow it to ingest multiple investor letters from different years for historical comparison\n",

   "source": "### YOUR CODE HERE\n\n# =============================================================================\n# PREAMBLE\n# =============================================================================\n#\n# This solution implements several enhancements to the base RAG application:\n#\n# 1. PARAGRAPH-BASED CHUNKING (EXPERIMENTAL - DID NOT WORK WELL)\n#    Added a new \"paragraph\" split mode to CharacterTextSplitter. Since PDF\n#    extraction doesn't reliably preserve paragraph boundaries, we use \" \\n\"\n#    (space followed by newline) as an approximation. However, it was not\n#    possible to accurately split by paragraphs with the output of the PDF\n#    parser. Single newlines within chunks are replaced with literal \\n.\n#\n# 2. DATA PREPROCESSING/CLEANUP\n#    Pre-filtered documents to remove \"Risk Disclosures\" sections before chunking.\n#    Initial results were poor because legal boilerplate dominated the retrieved\n#    context. Other approaches tried (exclusion searches, downranking legalese\n#    keywords) were less effective than simply removing disclaimers upfront.\n#\n# 3. MULTI-DOCUMENT SUPPORT\n#    Added additional investor letters (2023, 2024, 2025) to the data directory\n#    and pointed PDFFileLoader to the parent directory. This enables historical\n#    comparison across multiple years without modifying the loader itself.\n#\n# 4. ALTERNATIVE DISTANCE METRIC\n#    Added toggle between cosine similarity and Pearson correlation via the\n#    DISTANCE_METRIC constant. Both performed similarly on this dataset - cosine\n#    is generally optimal for normalized embeddings, but Pearson can capture\n#    relationships cosine might miss.\n#\n# 5. SOURCE METADATA\n#    Added metadata support to track which document each chunk originated from.\n#    The VectorDatabase now stores (vector, metadata) tuples, and search results\n#    include source information. Context sent to the LLM now shows [Source: filename]\n#    for each chunk, enabling the model to cite specific documents in its answers.\n#\n# 6. PER-DOCUMENT CONTEXT RETRIEVAL\n#    Added CONTEXT_PER_DOCUMENT flag to retrieve N chunks from each source document\n#    separately, rather than the top N globally. This is useful for comparison\n#    questions across documents (e.g., \"How has Stone Ridge's philosophy changed\n#    over time?\"). When enabled, NUM_CONTEXT_CHUNKS specifies the number of chunks\n#    to retrieve per document. Results are sorted using a two-step sort: first by\n#    source name to group chunks from the same document together, then by score\n#    descending within each group.\n#\n\n\n# =============================================================================\n# CONSTANTS\n# =============================================================================\n\n# Maximum number of characters per chunk\nCHUNK_SIZE = 1000\n\n# Number of overlapping characters between consecutive chunks (helps preserve context at boundaries)\nCHUNK_OVERLAP = 200\n\n# Chunking strategy: \"character\" splits at fixed intervals, \"paragraph\" splits on newlines\nSPLIT_MODE = \"character\"\n\n# Number of most similar chunks to retrieve (per document if CONTEXT_PER_DOCUMENT is True)\nNUM_CONTEXT_CHUNKS = 3\n\n# When True, retrieve NUM_CONTEXT_CHUNKS from each source document separately\nCONTEXT_PER_DOCUMENT = True\n\n# Response style passed to the LLM (e.g., \"detailed\", \"concise\", \"technical\")\nRESPONSE_STYLE = \"detailed\"\n\n# Response length passed to the LLM (e.g., \"brief\", \"efficient\", \"comprehensive\")\nRESPONSE_LENGTH = \"efficient\"\n\n# Default question to ask the RAG application\n#QUERY = \"What is Stone Ridge's investment philosophy?\"\nQUERY = \"Has Stone Ridge's investment philosophy evolved over the years?\"\n\n\n# =============================================================================\n# IMPORTS\n# =============================================================================\n\nimport os\nimport certifi\nimport asyncio\nimport nest_asyncio\n\nfrom aimakerspace.text_utils import PDFFileLoader, CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom aimakerspace.vectordatabase import VectorDatabase, cosine_similarity, pearson_correlation\nfrom aimakerspace.ai_utils.prompts import UserRolePrompt, SystemRolePrompt\nfrom aimakerspace.ai_utils.chatmodel import ChatAnthropic\n\nnest_asyncio.apply()\n\n# Distance metric for vector similarity: cosine_similarity or pearson_correlation\nDISTANCE_METRIC = pearson_correlation\n\n\n# =============================================================================\n# PROMPT TEMPLATES\n# =============================================================================\n\nRAG_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"You are a helpful investor letter assistant that answers questions about Stone Ridge's investment philosophy, market insights, and strategic outlook based strictly on provided context.\n\nInstructions:\n- Only answer questions using information from the provided context\n- If the context doesn't contain relevant information, respond with \"I don't have information about that in the investor letter\"\n- Be accurate and cite specific parts of the context when possible\n- Keep responses {response_style} and {response_length}\n- Only use the provided context.
